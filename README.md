Presented data and code are the supplemental material for the article.

•	Folder “data” contains image and segmentation files in nifti format (see data_description document)

•	Folder “generated_files” contains text files with numerical values of evaluation metrics, loss function at each training epoch, specific voxel intensities. Some of these files were used to generate figures for the article

• Codes and illustrative examples can be found in the “scripts_notebooks” folder
